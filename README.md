----

Besides being the most delicious fish in the world and one of the [signature Japanese dishes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unagi), `unagi` can also help you navigate through the [public](https://hsc.mtk.nao.ac.jp/ssp/) or [internal data release](https://hscdata.mtk.nao.ac.jp/hsc_ssp/) of the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) Subaru Strategic Program (SSP; also known as the HSC survey) -- an ambitious multi-band deeep photometric survey using the awesome prime-focus camera on the 8.2m Subaru telescope. 

Also, `unagi` does not stand for anything because forced acronym is for psychopath. 

If you want to learn more about the real unagi, you can check out [this video on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1sqLCUuMMfo).  And here is a vlog about a famous unagi place I have tried: [Obana 尾花](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N26pjkM_z4A).  It is pretty close to downtown Tokyo and few statioins away from Kavli-IPMU.
